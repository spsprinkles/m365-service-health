# M365 Service Health
The M365 Service Health app is a solution that reads service health data from a SharePoint list and presents it to non-admin users with an intuitive intrface. This data is typically retrieved from the Graph API via Power Automate and saved to a list that all users have read access to. This data is usually refreshed on a regular schedule (15 minutes).
